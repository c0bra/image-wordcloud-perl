        my $wc = Image::WordCloud->new();

        $wc->words([qw/
                    Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
                                    Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure We are met on a great battle field of that
                                    war We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live It is altogether fitting and
                                    proper that we should do this But in a larger sense we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this ground The brave men living and dead who struggled
                                    here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract The world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here
                                    It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced It is rather for us to be here dedicated
                                    to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion—that we
                                    here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people by the people
                                    for the people shall not perish from the earth
                    /]);
                
                    # Create the word cloud as a GD image
                    my $gd = $wc->cloud();
                
                    open(my $fh, '>', 'gettysburg.png');

                            print $fh $gd->png();
                    close($fh);
                
                    # See examples/gettysburg.png for how the created image looks. script/gettysburg.pl will create it
