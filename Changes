Revision history for Image-WordCloud

0.02_02

	[BUG FIXES]
	* _max_font_size() was returning sizes that were too small. It now returns
	  a size that will scale properly in cloud()
	
	[FEATURES]
	* Added a 'border_padding' option to new() that takes either a number in
	  pixels or a percentage.

	[BUG FIXES]
	* Long words were overrunning the image bounds. Added _max_font_size() which
	  tries the longest word in each font, scaling the font size down until it
	  will fit width the image's width. (Eventually this will need to be changed
	  to handle vertical words)
	* Long FIRST words were overrunning the image bounds too. The first (largest)
	  word was not being checked to make sure its placement fit within the image.
	  
	[TESTS]
	* Added tests so every method is covered. Added more tests for coverage.
